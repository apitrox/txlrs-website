# Create Image Prompt

## This prompt is used in Gemini Nano Banana to create an image for each blog post or topic. It is here just because this is where we save our system prompts for this project repository.

Create an image of Governor Abbott signing a child sweeping welfare reform bill, sitting at a desk/table with various dignitaries standing around/behind him. Everyone appears happy and is dressed professionally.  The image should be near-realistic, but upon close inspection, it is clear that it is computer-generated. The image should be resizable and optimized for use on a webpage, including an AMP-compatible page.
