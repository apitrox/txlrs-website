For the `txlrs-website` project make the following changes:
- For Locations, use this json array of json objects list of locations provided as part of this system prompt. The Locations dropdown should use the Location_Name and Location_Phone_Number.
- When a user first visits the website for a new session, before a page displays the website shall determine the user's location. If the user is outside of the state of Texas, the Locations dropdown shall default to the Austin location.  If the location is in the state of Texas, the Locations dropdown shall default to the location that is closest to the user, based on the user's latitude and longitude. The system shall use the user's latitude and longitude, and the latitude and longitude of each listed location, to determine which location is closest to the user. It can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem with the user's latitude and longitude and to each of location latitude and longitude. This will only be used at the beginning of each user session, not when the user navigates from page to page during a session.
