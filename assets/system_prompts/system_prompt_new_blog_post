## Task: Build a landing page for the topic of **habeas litigation and immigration bonds**

### English version  

- Create a new HTML file for the page.  
- Use the existing site header and footer (exactly the same as home page), for both large and small displays, preserving the site’s CSS/JS framework (Tailwind CSS), layout standards (responsive / mobile-first), and typography — headings in blue, body text in black, using Roboto font.  

#### Content & SEO Requirements  

- Provide a unique, descriptive `<title>` tag and `<meta description>` optimized for people searching for **habeas litigation and immigration bonds**. 
- Structure the page with proper HTML headings: H1 for the main heading; H2/H3 for subheadings where appropriate.  
- Create an appropriate and unique slug for the page with the focus on enhanced SEO.  
- The page is to be AMP (accelerated mobile page) compatible, even if this means to create a separate AMP page at `.../amp`.
- Write high-quality, people-first, neutral-tone content that demonstrates trustworthiness, authority, and expertise (E-E-A-T).  
- Use key words and phrases (and relevant variants / long-tail phrases) in a natural, context-appropriate way — moderate frequency, avoiding keyword stuffing, for the purpose of enhanced SEO.  
- Include an AI-generated illustration (not a generic stock photo), optimized and compressed for mobile web and AMP. Use an appropriate and unique alt tag for the image.  
- In the page `<head>` (or before closing `</body>`), add JSON-LD structured data using a schema type appropriate for lawyers and attorneys (e.g. `Attorney`), including properties:
    - `"@context": "https://schema.org"`
    - `"@type": "Immigration Attorney"`
    - `"serviceType": "Immigration Attorney"`
    - basic metadata such as `"name"`, `"description"`, `"url"` (and any other minimal required fields).  
  Do **not** include extended properties (like contact info or dates) — keep structured data minimal. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Include a clear call to action such as “Call or Text 24/7”, “Call now”, or “Contact us now!”. The phone number is global (header/footer), so the CTA need not repeat the number.  
- Ensure internal linking: add a link from your main `blog-post.html` (or other central listing page) to this new page, using appropriate anchor text and image.  
- Add the new page to `sitemap.xml`, and update the `lastmod` date accordingly.  

#### Compliance & Ethical / Legal Requirements  

- Always refer to attorneys/lawyers as “our network of attorneys” or “our network of lawyers.” Do **not** imply employment, direct control or that they are staff.  
- Do **not** give legal advice, or suggest or recommend any specific “do this” or “don’t do that” for a reader’s own case. Instead, frame content in generic or descriptive terms (e.g. “some clients in similar situations have…”, “others have chosen…”), and clearly indicate the information is informational only.  
- Avoid all black-hat or manipulative SEO tactics: no hidden text, no keyword stuffing, no cloaking, no doorway pages, no thin content.

### Spanish version  

- Create a Spanish-language copy at `/blog-post/[pageslug]-es.html`.  
- Use the **exact same** site header and footer as on the English version of the page (matching home page template), maintain CSS/JS, responsive layout, typography (Roboto, blue headings, black body).  
- Translate **all** visible content (headings, body text, CTA), metadata (`<title>`, `<meta description>`), and image alt-text into Spanish — targeting Spanish-speaking users/searchers.  
- Use Spanish for the structured-data `"serviceType"` value in the JSON-LD markup, and keep structured data minimal (service type + page metadata).
- On both English and Spanish pages, include a language toggle at the bottom: `English  |  Español`, linking respectively to each version.  
- Be sure that both the English and Spanish versions of each page are AMP compatible, or if appropriate for SEO purposes create a separate AMP page at `.../amp` for both the English and Spanish versions of the page.

---  
### Blog Posts Listing  

- On the site’s central `blog-post.html`, create an entry/listing for the new English version of the blog post page consistent formatting and language with other listings.
- Added as part of this listing, insert a link labeled `Español →` pointing to the Spanish version page (clicking the heading or body of the listing will link to the English version as does other listings).
- Do not use Houston or Texas in the name of the heading, it is not geographic specific.
- Sort all the listings on the page in alphabetical order based on the heading of each listing.

---  
### Finalization  

- Preview both English and Spanish pages to ensure correct rendering, responsive layout, correct styling (fonts/colors), and functioning navigation.  
- Update `blog-post.html` listing, internal links, and `sitemap.xml` (with `lastmod`).  
- Commit and push the changes.
- Provide a summary of what was done: file paths, metadata (titles/descriptions), structured-data JSON-LD snippet(s), image asset information (filename, compression details), links added/updated, and any relevant notes (e.g. translation decisions, compliance notes).
